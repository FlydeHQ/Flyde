# Welcome to Flyde!

Flyde is a powerful visual programming tool that allows you to build applications using a simple "nodes and wires" style. With Flyde, you can create visual flows that represent the logic and control flow of your application, using a variety of pre-built components or by building your own.

Flyde is designed to be intuitive and easy to use, even for those with little or no programming experience. It allows you to build complex applications quickly and easily, without getting bogged down in the technical details of how to do it. Whether you're a seasoned developer or just starting out, Flyde has something to offer.
